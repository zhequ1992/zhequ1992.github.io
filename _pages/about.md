I am the fifth year Ph.D. candidate at the University of South Florida under the supervision of [Prof. Zhuo Lu](https://csalab.site). I receivd a B.S. from the Department of Automation at [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/) in 2015, a M.S. from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/) in 2017.

I am broadly interested in distributed/federated learning for networking and security.
