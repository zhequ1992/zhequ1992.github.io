# About Me
I am a tenure-track associate professor at the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.csu.edu.cn/), [Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/). I received a B.S. from the Department of Automation at [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/) in 2015, an M.S. from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/) in 2017, and Ph.D. from the Department of Electrical Engineering at [University of South Florida](https://www.usf.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Zhuo Lu](https://csalab.site).

<r>Opening: I am looking for self-motivated Master students to join my group. Please send me a short email with your C.V. and anything you believe relevant!</r>
