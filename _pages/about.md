Welcom to Zhe Qu's homepage!

I am a tenure-track associate professor at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University. I receivd a B.S. from the Department of Automation at [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/) in 2015, a M.S. from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/) in 2017, and Ph.D. from the Department of Electrical Engineering at [University of South Florida](https://www.usf.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Zhuo Lu](https://csalab.site).

I am broadly interested in distributed/federated learning for networking and security.
